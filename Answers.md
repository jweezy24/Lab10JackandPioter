Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?
Yes the starting point makes a difference for each of them except for depth first which has same path except for
the starting point. Additionally, random walk can repeat but the others seem not to.

Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
Countries that have more than 4 countries bordering it and each country also borders the others you would need
more than four colors.
Additionally countries that have split lands than you may need more than four colors depending where the split part
is or how many countries border each part
